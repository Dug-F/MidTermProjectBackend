<h1>Bootcamp Resources Mid-Term Project by Async Avatars</h1>

This is the back end repo of a full stack bootcamp resources app.

<h2>Problem</h2>

The brief for the mid-term project was to produce an app that could help fellow bootcampers.  We were divided into teams of 6 with people with whom we had (mostly) not previously worked.  We became team Async Avatars.  

The School of Code bootcamp is extremely intense and presents bootcampers with a torrent of information at a rapid pace.  The information is in disparate places: documents, presentations, Slack channel, partial or completed code to name a few.  We identified this as an opportunity to help our fellow bootcampers - create an app to help organise bootcamp resources.

The entire project took place over the course of 5 days, roughly divided into :
- problem definition, user research, ideation, UI/UX design, wireframing, creating user personas and user stories over 2 days
- coding over 2 days
- finalising code, making a 10 minute video and presenting to a panel of judges.

This was an extremely tight timescale.

Our journey as a team, including a demo of the app is show in the video below (the demo starts at about 2:50):

You can find a link to the deployed site above or at the right-side of this page.  Please note that the hosting service hibernates the backend api after inactivity and there may be a delay of c. 20 secs before the app becomes fully operable on first access.

Because the app uses links that are personal to individual bootcampers, some of the links may appear broken for users that were not in the bootcamp.  For those users, viewing the demo in the above video is recommended.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

The project was a rich learning experience, on a very steep learning curve.

This was my first experience at the School of Code with a team of 6, which has a very different dynamic to a team of 3.  As a group we had some significant disagreements and learned the huge benefits of dot voting and 'disagree and commit'.  Even though there were aspects where we had different views, we were able to continue functioning effectively as a team with no lingering resentments.

It was also the first time where we defined our own brief and took it through problem definition, user research, problem confirmation/refinement, ideation, UI/UX design, wireframing, user personas and user stories.  All of these processes were new to us and as a result we learned an incredible amount about how the processes operate and the benefits of using them.  As an example, through user research we identified that we initially did not have the correct problem definition and were able to correct course before we had expended too much time and effort on the wrong objective.

Technically, it was the first time where we brought together an end-to-end solution, with the api backend feeding a frontend rendering the data from the api.  This was also a significant learing curve to achieve the result that we were seeking.

Above all, we learned how to function as a high-performance team under significant pressure with a challenging deadline.

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

**Client:** Javascript, HTML, CSS, Playwright

**Server:** JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, SuperTest, Vitest

<h2>How to run locally</h2>

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Dug-F/MidTermProjectBackend.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd MidTermProjectBackend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Create a PostgresSQL database (we used ElephantSQL)

Create a .env file
- for security reasons there is no .env file in the repo.
- create a file named .env in the root folder of the project with the following contentsL
    ```
    DB_CONNECTION_STRING="<connection string of database>"
    PORT="3000"
    ```
- note that the chevrons (<>) are not needed in the database connection string, they are purely to indicate where the connection string should go
- also note that you can use a different port number if desired

Initialise the database
- check the database seed date in \db\helpers and amend if desired
- ```npm run reset-database```
- you should see a 'database reset successful' message to indicate that the database has been correctly initialised

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```
